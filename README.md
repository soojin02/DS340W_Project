# DS340W_Project
# Automation Risk Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project explores how data and machine learning can be used to better understand **automation risk across different job roles**, focusing on how job characteristics and skill requirements relate to the likelihood of automation.

To make the project easier to understand before reviewing the code, a **Final paper.pdf** is included in this repository. The paper explains the motivation, data, methodology, and findings in a more accessible and structured way.

📄 **Recommended starting point:**  
Please read **Final paper.pdf** before exploring the code to gain context on the project and the reasoning behind the analysis.

## What This Project Explores

- How job characteristics and skill requirements relate to automation risk  
- Whether patterns in data can help identify roles that may be more or less vulnerable to automation  
- The limitations of predicting automation risk using available datasets  


---

## What We Did

- Worked with a structured job dataset containing job titles, industries, skill-related features, and automation risk labels  
- Cleaned and prepared the data for analysis, including encoding categorical variables  
- Tested multiple machine learning approaches to explore patterns in the data  
- Compared results across models to understand trade-offs, strengths, and limitations  

Throughout the project, emphasis was placed on **data organization, logical reasoning, and clear documentation** so that results could be understood even without a technical background.

## Key Takeaways

- Predicting automation risk is complex and highly dependent on data quality  
- Model accuracy alone is not enough to produce meaningful insights  
- Understanding limitations and documenting assumptions is critical  
- Clear communication is just as important as technical implementation
